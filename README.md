  Cideth Oliva and Khadija Wane

  **_Major Decisions_** is a full-stack web application designed to help students explore career paths by searching job titles or keywords and viewing related job postings, matching majors, and suggested courses. The goal is to reduce confusion around “What can I do with this major?” and give students a clearer, more interactive way to plan their future.
 
  **Target Browsers**
  
  Major Decisions is designed as a responsive web application and supports modern desktop and mobile browsers, including Google Chrome (desktop & Android), Safari (macOS & iOS), Mozilla Firefox (desktop), and Microsoft Edge (desktop).
