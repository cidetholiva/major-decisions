  # Major Decisions

  INST377: Final Project 
  
  Cideth Oliva and Khadija Wane

  **_Major Decisions_** is a web app that helps college students explore possible career paths based on their major. By connecting degree programs to real job titles and example postings, the tool lets students filter by interests, skills, and industries to see how different majors can translate into real-world roles. The goal is to reduce confusion around “What can I do with this major?” and give students a clearer, more interactive way to plan their future.

  **Target Browsers**
  
Major Decisions is designed as a responsive web application and supports modern desktop and mobile browsers, including Google Chrome (desktop & Android), Safari (macOS & iOS), Mozilla Firefox (desktop), and Microsoft Edge (desktop).
